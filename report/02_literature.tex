\section{Literature Review}

\textcite{calvano_artificial_2019} simulate two Q-Learning agents that not only achieve collusive outcomes, but also sustain their tacit agreement through a \emph{reward-punishment} scheme. \textcite{klein_autonomous_2019} shows that Q-Learning algorithms converge faster in a sequential price setting environment.
