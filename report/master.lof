Deviations are deemed \emph {profitable} if the discounted profits until $\tau = 10$ due to the deviation exceed cash flows from a counterfactual without deviation. Discounting is paramount to $\Delta $ in \textbf {equation X}, i.e.\ 0.95. The spike at zero is due to a significant number of 'deviations' that are neither profitable nor unprofitable. In those runs, the learned strategy of the deviating agent at $\tau = 1$ amounts to the best response and both agents keep following their respective price cycle.}}{70}{figure.13}%

Run \emph {12} shows the non deviating agent meeting the price cut. This also yields a new equilibrium with lower prices. Since the pre-deviation prices were slightly above the collusive benchmark, the new equilibrium actually improves both agent's profits in this particular example.}}{71}{figure.14}%
