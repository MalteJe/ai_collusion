	\section{To Do}
	List of useful \emph{quick \& dirty commands}:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item additional \space \space spaces \space \space \space with \texttt{\textbackslash space}
		\item \textbf{\textbackslash} \space via \texttt{\textbackslash textbackslash}
		\item \textbf{\textasciitilde} \space via \texttt{\textbackslash textasciitilde}
		\item \textbf{\ldots} \space via \texttt{\textbackslash ldots}
		
	\end{itemize}
	{\Huge Bibliography}
	also look at further hints in Microsoft/LinkedIn assignment file.
	
	\section{Hierarchy and References}\label{HaR}
	
	\subsection{Hierarchy}\label{Hie}
	
	The hierarchy is rather simple. There are \texttt{sections}, \texttt{subsections}, \texttt{subsubsections}, \texttt{paragraphs} \& \texttt{subparagraphs}. For instance, this text is located within a subsection. Luckily for us, \LaTeX \space takes care of incrementation.
	
	\subsubsection{Block Numbering}\label{sssbn}
	If we want don't want \LaTeX to assign numbers to a particular hierarchical element, one assign a \texttt{*} right after the command, e.g. \texttt{\textbackslash subsubsection*}
	
	\subsubsection*{Section without number}
	Hierarchically, this subsubsection is the successor of the previous subsubsection \ref{sssbn}.
	
	\subsubsection{Further hierarchy commands}
	The following hierarchical elements are rather uncommon and their functionality won't be described in detail. So, the following list serves merely as a collection:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Naturally, \texttt{\textbackslash appendix} is used in the end of the text
		\item \texttt{\textbackslash part} \& \texttt{\textbackslash chapter} can only be used in the document class \emph{book}
		\item \texttt{\textbackslash frontmatter} is printed before the main text (if it is used, the main text should be started with \texttt{\textbackslash mainmatter})
		\item Similarly, \texttt{backmatter} is appended at the end
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Calling other text files}
	In order to keep the size of a file manageable, a script can include references to other text files. The compiler will then include the text from that text file in the generated file. The required command is \texttt{\textbackslash include}. 

\subsection{References}
	\LaTeX \space can reference pretty much anything. The requirement is that the referenced object is labeled by \texttt{\textbackslash label}.
	
	\subsubsection{Default References}\label{dr}
	The default command to reference something is \texttt{\textbackslash ref}. For instance, we can refer to section \ref{HaR}, subsection \ref{Hie}, subsubsection \ref{sssbn}, table \ref{diamondsreg} \& figure \ref{tokyo}. On top of that one can refer to pages, e.g. the start of this paragraph is on page \pageref{dr}.
	
	\subsubsection{Hyperref}
	The package \emph{hyperref} steps up the default referencing. It introduces the command \texttt{\textbackslash autoref} which automatically returns the type of reference as well (e.g. you don't need to type `section' or `subsection' by yourself): As an example, look at the referencing towards \autoref{HaR}, \autoref{Hie}, \autoref{diamondsreg} \& \autoref{tokyo}.
	Hyperref does two more things:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item it creates links between references and the Table of Contents. This allows a reader of the final \emph{pdf} to comfortably jump between sections.
		\item by default, it marks all references with a red frame. Personally, I like this while working in TexStudio but not really in the final pdf. It can be turned off by the option \texttt{hidelinks} when calling the package.
	\end{enumerate}



	\subsubsection{URLs and local file paths}
	
	Referencing URLs also works with \emph{hyperref}. Two options are available:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item using the \texttt{\textbackslash url} command: \url{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html} 
		\item using the \texttt{\textbackslash href} command:
		\href{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html}{R for Data Science}
	\end{itemize}
Both examples link the same page. The first displays the full link while the second uses a description of the page. Local file paths can be referenced in the same way. Here are links to the book
\href{run:C:/Users/psymo/OneDrive/Studium/Statistik/Dokumente/ISL/An Introduction to Statistical Learning.pdf}{\emph{Introduction to Statistical Learning}} and a picture of \href{run:C:/Users/psymo/Pictures/Korea/Korea/20190630_154735_HDR.jpg}{\emph{Ha Long Bay}}. Note that this linkage doesn't work in the previewer of TexStudio. You'll have to compile and open the real pdf for the links to work.

\subsection{Footnotes}
Footnotes are implemented with \texttt{\textbackslash footnote}. This is a sentence with an exemplary footnote\footnote{This is a footnote}.

	\section{Various}
	Due to the UTF-8 encoding, all German peculiarities are processed without problems: "ÄäÖöÜüß". Also note, that the language checking works as specified in the \emph{babel} package.
	
	That is great. At this point I want to check if \LaTeX knows about hyphenation and in order to do so I'll have to think of some sentences with some especially long word creations. The previous sentence convinced me that \LaTeX is capable of proper hyphenation.
	
	\subsection{Font Types}
	Single words can be printed in a different font. There are many types of fonts:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textmd{standard fonts via} \texttt{\textbackslash textmd}
		\item \textit{Italic} 
		\item \textbf{fat}
		\item \textsf{without serifs}
		\item \texttt{designed to print code where every letter has the same width}
		\item \textsc{capped names}
		\item \textsl{aslope}
		\item \underline{Underlined}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{Colored text} 
		\item \colorbox{green}{Marked text}
	\end{itemize}

\texttt{\textbackslash emph} ensures that an appropriate \emph{accentuation} for the current environment is chosen at all times.

	\subsection{Font Size}
One can change the font size, though in most circumstances this is not recommended, especially in a scientific text. The levels are:

\begin{itemize}
	\item {\tiny tiny}
	\item {\scriptsize scriptsize}
	\item {\footnotesize footnotesize}
	\item {\small small}
	\item {\normalsize normalsize (the default)}
	\item {\large large}
	\item {\Large Large}
	\item {\LARGE LARGE}
	\item {\huge huge}
	\item {\Huge Huge}
\end{itemize}


	\begin{scriptsize}
		Alternatively an environment can be called to change the text size for a longer text passage.
	\end{scriptsize}


\subsection{Quote and dash variations}
	There are many ways to quote. Which way is correct depends on the type of text and personal preferences. The most common ways are:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item `British single quotes' (I think this is my favorite)
		\item ``American double quotes'' (I think more common)
		\item \glqq German Quotation.\grqq.Test
		\item ``double quotes allows for `quotes inside quotes' ''
	\end{itemize}

The typical dashes that are available include:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item default - dash
		\item some -- dash
		\item large --- dash
		\item math $-$ dash
	\end{itemize}





	\subsection{Formatting}
	
\texttt{\textbackslash blindtext} is a nice way to test the current formatting options that are applied at a particular location of the text (in this example within the \texttt{quote} environment):
\begin{quote}
	\blindtext
\end{quote}


\subsubsection{line breaks}
Line breaks can be forced with \texttt{\textbackslash \textbackslash}. In order to increase the tweak the line spacing an optional argument can be used in square brackets.\\

{\setlength\parindent{0pt}
	I'm lost for words\\
	The truth hurts\\
	Behind walls of silence\\
	where I am caught \\[0.5cm]
	I'm lost for words\\
	The truth hurts\\
	The times I have the most to say\\
	are the times I can't talk
\\

Words or names that belong together can be glued together. A counterexample is \emph{Rio de Janeiro}. Spelling out the city name over two lines looks odd. Instead, use \textasciitilde \space to connect the single components as in \emph{Rio~de~Janeiro}.
}
\subsubsection{Indention}
By default, \LaTeX indents the first word of a a paragraph after another one has ended. Usually, this is useful and looks professional. However, sometimes this might be unwanted.

\begin{itemize}
	\item For instance, after an itemization, I think indention isn't particularly useful.
\end{itemize}

{\setlength\parindent{0pt}  \texttt{\textbackslash setlength\textbackslash parindent} in curly parentheses controls the amount of indention. Setting the mandatory argument to \emph{0pt} avoids indention altogether.}

Moreover, the indention of whole passage works with \texttt{\textbackslash quote}:
\begin{quote}
	``And I will strike down upon thee, those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers, and you will know my name is the lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.''
\end{quote}
		
	\subsubsection{Hyphenation}
	Given the right language package is used, \LaTeX \space usually hyphenates words automatically when appropriate. Occasionally, it may struggle with foreign words such as archae\-opterix. In those cases, use \textbackslash - within the word to mark the appropriate places to hyphenate.
	
	\subsection{Centering}
	Single text elements can be centered by creating a new \texttt{center} environment:
	
	\begin{center}
		This text is centered.\\
		$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
	\end{center}

A \emph{quick and dirty} alternative is \texttt{\textbackslash centering} but I don't like it that much.
	
	\subsection{Itemization \& Enumeration}
	Listings work via the \texttt{\textbackslash itemize} environment. Enumerations are built with \texttt{\textbackslash enumerate}. Partitioning over more than one layer works by using more than one environment:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item first bulletpoint
		\item second bulletpoint with subsections
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item first option
			\item second option
		\end{enumerate}
		\item third bulletpoint
			\begin{itemize}
				\item [a)]  The style of the bullet points can also be set manually
				\item [b)] However, \LaTeX \space doesn't really like that. It might be a good idea to stick to the defaults.
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	
	\newpage
	
	\section{Tables and Figures}
	
	\subsection{Tables}
		Creating tables in \LaTeX is rather inefficient and involved. Below is an example of a manually created table:\\
		
	\begin{table}
		\caption{Excellent Songs}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|r|l|}
		\hline
		\multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\textbf{Excellent Songs}} \\
		\hline \hline
		\textbf{song}&\textbf{artist}&\textbf{price}&\textbf{comment} \\
		\hline
		Infinite&Eminem&0,99&Very Good \\
		\hline
		Lady (Hear me Tonight)&Modjo&0,69&Excellent track during summer \\
		\hline
		Still D.R.E.&Dr. D.R.E.&1,29&this is an excellent song \\
		&Snoop Dog&&of two gangsta exhibits who\\
		&&&swear that the game hasn't changed and\\
		&&& both of them remain rightful kings\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	There are many tools which ease the pain of \LaTeX tables (e.g. \emph{Stargazer} to print Regression tables from `R'):
	
	\begin{table}[!htbp] \centering 
		\caption{Diamonds Linear Regression} 
		\label{diamondsreg} 
		\begin{tabular}{@{\extracolsep{5pt}}lc} 
			\\[-1.8ex]\hline 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex] 
			& \multicolumn{1}{c}{\textit{Dependent variable:}} \\ 
			\cline{2-2} 
			\\[-1.8ex] & carat \\ 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]

			Observations & 53,940 \\ 
			R$^{2}$ & 0.969 \\ 
			Adjusted R$^{2}$ & 0.969 \\ 
			Residual Std. Error & 0.083 (df = 53936) \\ 
			F Statistic & 568,906.900$^{***}$ (df = 3; 53936) \\ 
			\hline 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex] 
			\textit{Note:}  & \multicolumn{1}{r}{$^{*}$p$<$0.1; $^{**}$p$<$0.05; $^{***}$p$<$0.01} \\ 
		\end{tabular} 
	\end{table}
	
	\subsection{Figures}
\LaTeX can import many pictures stored in various file formats and include them in the resulting pdf. The picture file must be located in the same folder as the \emph{.Tex} file.

		\newpage
	\section{Math} \label{form}
	This section is old but might help looking up some commands and templates.
	
	Formeln lassen sich ähnlich Microsofts Formel-Editor einfügen. Der Vorteil ist, dass man aufgrund der befehlbasierten Logik potenzielle Tippfehler besser korrigieren kann: $ x^2 =6 $. Zentrierte Formeln sind auch möglich:
	\begin{center}
		$ y_i =x_1*\beta_1 $
	\end{center}
	
	Hier sind die bekannten Regeln anzuwenden. Man kann tolle Sachen zaubern!
	\subsection{Matrizen}
	Matrizen lassen sich über '\&' sowie '\verb=\=' verarbeiten:
	
	\begin{center}
		$
		\begin{Bmatrix}
		y_{1,1} & y_{1,2} & \dots & y_{1,n} \\
		y_{2,1} & y_{2,2} & \dots & y_{2,n} \\
		\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		y_{m,1} & y_{m,2} & \vdots & y_{m,n}
		\end{Bmatrix}
		$
	\end{center}
	
	\subsection{Summen}
	\label{sums}
	Summen sind toll. Hier werden sie über die Alternative zur Einleitung von Formeln eingegeben. Dadurch wird immer ein neuer Absatz erstellt und zentriert.
	\[  \sum_{i=1}^n \]
	
	\subsection{Brüche und Wurzeln}
	Für Brüche wird der \textbf{frac}-Befehl genutzt.
	\[ \frac{a^2+b^2}{c^2+\frac{d}{n}} \]
	
	Wurzeln sind einfach ein Klassiker:
	\[ \sqrt[3]{Inhalt} \]
	
	
	\newpage
	
	\newpage
	\section{Crafting and automating the bibliography}
	Once set up there, \LaTeX in conjunction with JabRef and a bibliography tool takes care of citations. Take this as an example for an imaginary article in a journal citation\footnote{\cite{demo_art}}.
	Here comes a citation of an imaginary book.\footnote{\cite{demo_book}} Moreover, here is an American style reference to an article that was inserted into the pseudo database by Google Scholar's BibTeX function.(\cite{demo_source})
	
	\subsection{Workflow}
	
	Before passing different sources, a few global parameters must be set. These steps must be undertaken once:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Set up a .bib file and save it in the same directory as the .tex file. JabRef is a nice tool for that. The user interface suggests that a pseudo database is created which makes working with the files easier.
		\item In the file's header load the package \texttt{biblatex} with the appropriate options (see \autoref{config})
		\item Still in the file's header, specify the name of the .bib file with \texttt{\textbackslash addbibresource}
		\item Type \texttt{\textbackslash printbibliography} before the \emph{document} environment is closed (i.e. after the main text but before \texttt{\textbackslash end\{document\} }
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Once that is set up, the workflow for single quotes is like this.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item include a source in the JabRef pseudo database. There are two options to do this.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item manually enter all required information including a unique bibtexkey to refer to the source
				\item look online for the BibTex source code. There are some sites where those can be obtained (eg. Google Scholar). A bibtexkey is set by default but can be altered  to fit individual preferences
			\end{enumerate}
		\item use \texttt{\textbackslash cite} and refer to the Bibtexkey in curly brackets.
		\item optionally set up additional parameters in squared brackets to appear before or after the source\footnote{\cite[see][p. 12]{grapov2018rise}}.
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Configurations}\label{config}
	There are many options to control the citation style. For instance, the argument \texttt{citestyle} determines how citations are implemented in the text and \texttt{bibstyle} affects how the sources are implemented in the list of references at the end. Some information on style options can be obtained \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Biblatex_citation_styles}{\textbf{\color{blue}here}}.
	
	\subsection{Troubleshooting}
	
	If the workflow doesn't work, the first attempt to solve this should be to re-run the whole thing. If this doesn't work, check the following options:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{TexStudio:} Bibliography $\rightarrow$ Type: \emph{BibLaTeX}
		\item \textbf{TexStudio:} Options $\rightarrow$ Configure TexStudio $\rightarrow$ Build\\ $\rightarrow$ Default Bibliography Tool = \emph{Biber}
		\item \textbf{JabRef:} Options $\rightarrow$ General $\rightarrow$ Default Bibliography mode = \emph{biblatex}
	\end{itemize}

The next step is to update or add one entry in JabRef and saving the changes in the .bib file. Following that, delete the existing .aux, .bbl, .bcf files in the directory of the .tex file and re-run three times. If this doesn't work use google for help. Those two sites are pretty extensive for troubleshooting:

	\item \url{https://ipfs-sec.stackexchange.cloudflare-ipfs.com/tex/A/question/63852.html}
	\item 	\url{https://ipfs-sec.stackexchange.cloudflare-ipfs.com/tex/A/question/286706.html}
